# Defuse this Python Bomb

This repo provides a Linux docker container accessible to students over the web (and thus on Chromebooks) via Wetty. From there, students can use the command line to defuse the _bomb_ program.

## Building

1. Download the Python dissambler pyc2bytecode from its [git repo](https://github.com/knight0x07/pyc2bytecode). Students can use this program to disassemble the compiled "bomb" and determine the correct input to defuse it.
